              <p className="mb-6">This Privacy Policy explains how HyperKit (“HyperKit”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and
protects information when you access or use our website, dashboard, SDKs, APIs, documentation, and
any related services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
              <p className="mb-6">By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you
should not access or use the Service.</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">2. Information we collect</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Depending on how you interact with the Service, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-white">Account and contact information:</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Name, email address, organization, role, and other details you provide when you sign up for an account,

              <p className="mb-6">Limited billing details (such as subscription plan and payment status). Payment card information is

or others.</p>  
              <p className="mb-3 text-white">In connection with business transitions:</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Such as mergers, acquisitions, financing, or asset sales, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>
              <p className='mb-6'>We may share aggregated or de-identified data that does not identify you personally.</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">8. Data retention</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">We retain personal information for as long as necessary to:</p>
              <p className="mb-3 ml-6">Provide and support the Service.</p>
              <p className="mb-3 ml-6">Comply with legal, tax, or accounting requirements.</p>
              <p className='mb-3 ml-6'>Resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

possible.</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">9. Data security</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information against unauthorized
access, loss, misuse, or alteration, taking into account the nature of the data and the risks involved.</p>
              <p className='mb-6'>No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and you are responsible for maintaining the
security of your own credentials, devices, and wallets.</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">10. Your rights and choices</h2>

security, or privacy practices. You should review their privacy policies before using their services or

              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">4. Intellectual property</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Unless otherwise indicated (for example, open-source repositories with their own licenses), the Service

              <p className="mb-6">The Service may integrate or interoperate with third-party services, networks, smart contracts, chains, or
tools (for example, wallets, RPC providers, indexing services, or protocol SDKs), and may contain links to
third-party websites or resources.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">HyperKit does not control and is not responsible for:</p>
              <p className="mb-6 ml-6">The content, security, or practices of any third-party service or site.</p>
              <p className="mb-6 ml-6">Take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined by HyperKit) an unreasonable or
disproportionately large load on the Service or related infrastructure.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">Your use of third-party services is governed by those parties’ own terms and policies. You are solely
responsible for reviewing and complying with them.</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">7. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">The Service, including any developer tools, SDKs, APIs, agents, templates, or smart contract examples, is
provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express,
implied, or statutory. Without limiting the foregoing, HyperKit does not warrant that: (a) the Service will be
uninterrupted, secure, or error-free; (b) any defects will be corrected; or (c) the Service will be free of
viruses or other harmful components.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will HyperKit or its founders, team members,
contractors, partners, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
damages, or for any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising out of or relating to
your use of or inability to use the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
              <p className='mb-6'>To the extent any liability cannot be excluded, HyperKit’s aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the
Service or these Terms will be limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you paid to HyperKit in fees in the
twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim; or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD
100).</p>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-white tracking-tight mt-12 mb-4">8. Indemnification</h2>
